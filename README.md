# Iris Dataset Classification

This project implements machine learning classification models on the famous Iris dataset. The model predicts the species of iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Features include:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files
- `Iris Dataset.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the analysis and model implementation
- `iris.csv`: Dataset file
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
